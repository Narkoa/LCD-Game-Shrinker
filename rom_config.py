Various parameters for different ROM files
the repository of the original ROM files is composed of:
<rom_name> directory /
		- BackgroundNS.png 	 (mandatory)
		- <rom name>.svg		 (mandatory)
		- binary program 		 (mandatory)
		- melody 			 			 (optional)

> background_file
 This is the background ! BackgroundNS.png.or fanart .png

> segment_file
 This is the SVG file where the segments are defined (.svg)

> program_file
 the raw binary program file

> melody_file
 the raw binary melody file (if it exists)

> border_trim (not used)
 used during the rescaling of artwork to keep or remove the borders
 border_trim=True : remove the border otherwise keep it

> full name
 The name of the generated file at the end

> CPU to emulate
 indicates which CPU need to be emulated
 from MAME source code or .ini files, hh_sm510.cpp
 The follwing values are supported
 CPU_TYPE="SM512__\0"
 CPU_TYPE="SM511__\0"
 CPU_TYPE="SM510__\0"
 CPU_TYPE="SM500__\0"
 CPU_TYPE="SM5A___\0"

> background dimensions (applied on backgroundNS.png)
> screen dimensions (applied on .svg)
> border dimensions (applied on .svg)

 ### Parameters from MAME layout file default.lay
 # <view name="Background Only (No Shadow)">
 background_x=0
 background_y=0
 background_width=1290
 background_height=854

 screen_x=35
 screen_y=17
 screen_width=1221
 screen_height=802

> flag_rendering_lcd_inverted = True or False
graphic rendering (multiply)
 If false (default case)
 by default the background is from the background artwork file
 the background and non_white segment pixels are 'RGB multiply".
 or
 If True ( case "tabletop" or "inverted lcd screen")
 by default the background is black
 if a segment state is ON, the artwork file and the non_black segment pixels are 'RGB multiply".

 > flag_background_jpeg =True or False
 JPEG is used to compress the artwork file.

> jpeg_quality=90
typical values : 80 to 95
The following presets are available by default:
``web_low``, ``web_medium``, ``web_high``, ``web_very_high``, ``web_maximum``,
``low``, ``medium``, ``high``, ``maximum``.

> background_resolution = RGB565
The background image resolution can reduced using this feature.
